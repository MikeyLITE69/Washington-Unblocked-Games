# PROJECT WASHINGTON 🛡️

**Unblocked Games, Proxy, Movies & More – Bypass restrictions at school or work.**

## 🚀 What is Project S0lace?

Project Washington is a self-hostable, open-source web proxy + entertainment hub designed for students and anyone stuck behind restrictive networks (schools, workplaces, etc.). It combines:

- Lots of unblocked HTML5/Flash-emulated games
- Built-in web proxy (Scramjet + Titanium Network backends)
- Free streaming movies & TV shows (via partner sources)
- Stealth mode (cloaks as a normal school/work tab)
- No ads, no tracking, no data collection

**Play games and watch movies where everything else is blocked.**
